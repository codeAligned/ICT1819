# Silver Problems

Most of these involved one or two key intuitions, but all of them were quite difficult implementation problems. Make sure you have all your fundamentals down: when to use binary search, how to properly use priority queues, linked lists, etc.

When doing these in practice (at least in C++), note that almost all intended solutions have runtimes of less than like 100ms (C++). If your solution is really really close, but passes, try to see what you can optimize further (of couse, only in practice! In the real thing, if you get all of them just be happy and move on).
